It seems you want to create or update a `README.md` file that combines the content from both the frontend (`react-task-tracker`) and backend (`task-tracker-backend`) directories. Below is a consolidated version you can use:

# Task Tracker

This repository contains the complete setup for the **Task Tracker** project, including both the frontend and backend code. Below is an overview of the project structure and setup instructions.

---

## Frontend: React + Vite

The frontend of this project is built using **React** and **Vite**. It provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

### Key Features:
- Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh with the [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react).
- Optionally, you can use [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh with the [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc).

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration:
If you are developing a production application, we recommend:
- Using **TypeScript**.
- Enabling type-aware lint rules.

For TypeScript configurations, check the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).

## Backend: Task Tracker Backend

The backend of this project provides the server-side logic and API endpoints required for the Task Tracker application. It ensures seamless communication between the frontend and the database.

### Key Features:
- Built to complement the React-based frontend.
- Follows modern backend development practices.
